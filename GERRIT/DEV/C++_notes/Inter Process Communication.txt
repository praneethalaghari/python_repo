What is Interprocess communication?

Each process will have its own address space
Interprocess communication allows processess to communicate among themselves for synchronization and shared memory resource purposes


There ar three ways to achive IPC :
	1. Shared Memory
	2. Message Passing
	3. Signals
	4. pipes,fifo


	
Shared Memory :

    1. File Sharing : A file can be used to communicate which can be accessisble to both the processses
	2. A shared memory is createdd by one process and give access to other process to communicate
	
	   This is achieved via 
	    shmget() - Create shared memory,
		shmat()  - Attach the process to the created shared memory segment
		shmdt()  - Detach the process from shared memory after use
		
		shmget(key,size,shmflg)
		
		Disadvantages of other ways :
		
 		 Server reads from the input file.
 		 The server writes this data in a message using either a pipe, fifo or message queue.
 		 The client reads the data from the IPC channel,again requiring the data to be copied from kernel’s IPC buffer to the client’s buffer.
		 Finally the data is copied from the client’s buffer.
		 
		 A total of four copies of data are required (2 read and 2 write).
		 
		 So wastage of space.. but with shared memory concept data only copied twice
		     i.e input -> shared memory    aand     sharedmemory - > output buffer
		
	
	
	
	
	Inorder to see the process id use the following methods :
getpid(),getppid()
