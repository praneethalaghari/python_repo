What is threading?
Thread is a light weight process which can perform its task individually.

How many processors/core in i3,i5 and i7?
i3 - 2 cores
i5 - 4 cores
i7 - 4 (6-8 also)

How many threads can a core manage?
If the core has Hyper-Threading it can process two per core
If the code dont it can pocess only one per core
i3,i7 have HT where as i5 dont have HT

What is multi threading?

  When a program is executed.. scheduler selects one of the process to execute in any of the available processors..
  Each process executing has a parent or main thread i.e main..
  We can subdivide into multiple thread using thread.. and thus based on cores we can attain concurrency and parallelism as well.
  

What is difference between Thread and Processess?
  Thread is a light weight process					-	Process is little more overweigh than thread
  Thread container is process						- 	Process container is program
  Thread share in-process memory					- 	Process have their own memory
  Cost of communication between thread is less  			- 	IPC is costly
  Creation,termination of thread is fast				- 	Creation,termination of thread is slow
  Share resources via shared memory					- 	Use files,shared memory,pipes/queues	
  Threads take less time to switch					- 	Process take more time to switch
