What are thread synchronization mechanisms

what is the difference between mutex and semaphore

Difference between list and tuple,applications (i.e where we have to use)
	List is mutable;tuple is immutable
	Size of list is more;tuple is less;
	Access of list is slower when compared to tuple
	
	Application : Used in function call by value.. i.e value is for reference; tuple is for const reference


How to access bits in a byte
	We can access bits in a number via bitwise operators.
	
	1. & (and)	2. | (or) 
	3. <<	    4. >>	
	5. ^        6. ~

What are the difference between Little Endian & Big Endian processors
	In little endian the value is stored in reverse order.. i.e from right to left
	In Big Endian the value is stored in same order of insertion.. i.e from left to right
	
	Eg 0001 will be stored as 1000 in little endian
	   0001 will be stored as 0001 in Big endian
	 
	All the intel processors are little endian, Motorola is an example for Big endian.
	
	Test : int i = 1;
		   char* p = (char*) (&i);
		   if(*p)
		     cout << "Little Endian";
		   else
		     cout << "Big Endian";


What is a copy constructor/Move constructor and its applications

Can we have a pointer to register variable
	No, it is not possible to point to an register variable.. because.. register variable will be residing in CPU registers not in RAM
	Hence it is not possible to fetch/point to a variable in register.

Storage classes in C/C++
	auto,extern,register,static.. In C++ typedef and mutable storage classes are added

What are the differnces between structure and union

Where we can use union ?
	Union will take the size of maximum datatype residing in the union declaration.
	It will reside only in that one address space
	
	Application : Union is used, when we dont know the result of an expression.. i.e the result could be int,float,double,long double.
	              So instead of using a struct(alocating) different variables for each.. we can go with union to fill any of one..as we know only one variable will get filled.
				  So in simple words, struct is used when all variables needs to be used.. where as union is used when only one that too any of the variable might be used.
	
	              If we want to insert identity information of data of a person.. the persion identity can be either ID or name..
				  So we can create union named details and we can insert either ID/name. 
	
Which STL container is better ?
	
	

What happens if vector/STL is there in copy constructor >
	Though the memory of elements inside vector/list etc.. are dynamically allocated.. 
	there is no need of defining copy/assignment constructors explicitly.. i.e via a default constructor itself
	A new vector copy is allocated in new object in a new memory location and copy all the contents inside it
	Even one vector's value is changed, the other wont be changed.

Difference between auto and shared pointer

What are the differences between different types of pointers
	Despite of the type of pointer, all the pointers will consume same memory i.e  4 bytes for 32 bit processor and 8 bytes for 64 bit processor.
	The primary difference is iteration steps.. i.e int will advance to 4 bytes when incremented by 1; char by 1 byte; double by 8 and struct depends on data members. 

Why the size of list is more than that of a tuple

What is the difference between string of C++/string of python
	String is mutable in C++(char arr[]) where as string is immutable in python

What is the primary difference between C++ and python
	Interpreter/Compiler
	Security
	Speed of execution
	Automatic garbage collection
	library support
	Access specifiers

If we put static in header file and is included in some source file will it be same address in each of file.. or seperate i.e change in one will affect another?

if we have same param but we expect different return type what should we use? 

why we want copy constructor if we can do it via assignment operator?

Why to go for vector if deque can add elements at beginning and end at O(1)
