A function is which gives output after every objct is processed (if input is list of objects)

Example :


def square(p):
    for i in p:
        return i**2

x = [6, 3, 1]
print(square(x))




A generator is which gives output for each object is processed (if input is list of objects)

Example :

x = [6, 3, 1]

g = (i**2 for i in x)  # generator expression

print(next(g))         # -> 36
