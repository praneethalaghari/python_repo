Less the Standard deviation less the outliers i.e all are nearer to average
even mean and median are equal.. that doesnt mean that all are in average values.. there may be balance with positive outliers with negative outliers 

  Application : The lower the standard deviation of their ratings in each category, the more balanced and consistent they will tend to be. Teams with a higher standard                 deviation, however, will be more unpredictable.
